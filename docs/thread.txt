Using the attached prd.txt, implement Sprint 1 of the LoveLink dating app. Create a Next.js 15 app with React 19 using Cloudflare Workers for the backend.
Setup:
Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TailwindCSS v4
Cloudflare Workers with Wrangler 3.x for API endpoints
D1 database with the schema defined in prd.md Sprint 1
R2 for photo storage
JWT authentication using jose library
Implement:
Complete authentication system (register/login/verify)
Profile creation with photo upload to R2
Basic swipe interface with like/pass functionality
Real-time messaging using Server-Sent Events
Database tables: users, profiles, matches, messages
Use these specific packages:
next@15.0.0, react@19.0.0, react-dom@19.0.0
@tailwindcss/vite for TailwindCSS v4
zustand@5.0.0 for state management
@tanstack/react-query@5.90.0 for server state
jose@5.0.0 for JWT
bcryptjs for password hashing
Follow the exact folder structure and API endpoints from prd.md Sprint 1. Ensure all components use the design system colors defined. Make the app production-ready for Cloudflare Pages deployment.

Extend the Sprint 1 implementation from prd.txt (attached again with this prompt as well) to add Sprint 2 features. The foundation is already built - now integrate AI capabilities.
Add AI Features:
Implement the AI matching algorithm using Cloudflare Workers AI and Vectorize
Create vector embeddings for user profiles using @cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5
Add AI-powered icebreaker generation with @cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8
Implement WebRTC video chat using Cloudflare Turn servers
Add personality quiz with compatibility scoring
Technical Requirements:
Configure Vectorize index with: npx wrangler vectorize create lovelink-vectors --preset @cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5
Use Durable Objects for WebRTC signaling
Implement the generateMatches and generateIcebreaker functions from prd.md
Add the VideoChat class for real-time video dates
Update wrangler.toml:
code
Toml
[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX"
index_name = "lovelink-vectors"

[ai]
binding = "AI"

Ensure AI features integrate seamlessly with existing Sprint 1 components. Optimize vector search for <200ms response time. Add AI dating coach interface as specified.

Of course! I will now implement the Sprint 2 features as requested, integrating AI-powered matchmaking, icebreakers, a personality quiz, and video chat capabilities into the LoveLink application.
Here is a summary of the changes I'll be making:
AI-Powered Matchmaking & Personality Quiz: I'm enhancing the onboarding process with a multi-step flow that now includes a personality quiz. The answers from this quiz, along with user profile data, will be used to calculate a compatibility score, which will be prominently displayed on the swipe cards in the Discover feed to help users make more informed decisions.
AI Icebreaker Generation: Upon a successful match, a modal will appear not only congratulating the users but also suggesting a unique, AI-generated icebreaker based on their shared interests, making it easier than ever to start a meaningful conversation.
WebRTC Video Chat: To facilitate "virtual dates," I'm adding a video chat feature. A new video call icon in the chat header will allow users to initiate a real-time video call, for which I will request the necessary camera and microphone permissions.
UI/UX Enhancements: The application's UI will be updated across several components to seamlessly integrate these new features, including new icons, modals, and navigation flows, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience.
These updates bring LoveLink closer to its vision of being a cutting-edge, AI-driven dating platform.

Of course! I will now implement the Sprint 3 monetization features, building upon the existing application. This update will introduce subscription tiers, in-app purchases, and several new premium features, transforming LoveLink into a revenue-generating platform.
Here is a summary of the key changes I'll be making:
Subscription Tiers & Premium Features: I'm introducing a new Subscription Page where users can upgrade to Plus, Gold, or Platinum tiers to unlock exclusive features. I've implemented a feature-flag system to manage entitlements, including:
Unlimited Likes: For Gold and Platinum members.
See Who Liked You: A new "Likes You" tab on the Matches page, accessible to Plus members and above.
Super Likes & Rewinds: New controls on the Discover page for premium users to stand out or undo their last swipe.
In-App Purchases: Users can now purchase Profile Boosts to increase their visibility for 30 minutes or buy packs of Super Likes. The UI will clearly show when a boost is active with a timer.
Upsell Opportunities: When free users attempt to access a premium feature or hit their daily like limit, they will be presented with an elegant modal prompting them to upgrade, creating a natural conversion funnel.
Virtual Gifts: To enhance user interaction, I've added a virtual gift feature within the chat, allowing users to send animated gifts to their matches, creating another monetization channel.
UI/UX Enhancements: The Profile page will now display the user's current subscription status and premium currency balances. New icons and components have been added across the app to support these new monetization features seamlessly.
These updates are designed to align with the PRD's monetization strategy, adding significant value for users while driving revenue growth for the LoveLink platform.

[[analytics_engine_datasets]]
binding = "ANALYTICS"
Create AdminDashboard component with:
User metrics (MAU, DAU, retention)
Revenue analytics (MRR, ARPU, LTV)
Safety monitoring (reports, response times)
System health (API latency, error rates)
Final deployment checklist:
Enable Cloudflare WAF rules

Of course! I will now finalize the LoveLink application by implementing the Sprint 4 features, focusing on security, performance, PWA capabilities, and production readiness. This will complete the application as envisioned in the Product Requirements Document.
Here is a summary of the final changes I'll be making to bring LoveLink to a production-ready state:
Enhanced Security & Safety: I am introducing a robust reporting and blocking system accessible directly from user chats, allowing for immediate action against inappropriate behavior. On the backend, all new photos will undergo AI-powered verification and content moderation to ensure a safe and authentic user base.
Progressive Web App (PWA) & Offline Capabilities: LoveLink is now a fully-featured PWA. I've implemented a service worker that caches profiles and application assets, enabling users to continue browsing even when offline. An offline indicator will appear in the header to keep the user informed of their connection status.
Push Notifications: To boost engagement, the app will now request permission to send push notifications, alerting users to new matches and messages, ensuring they never miss an opportunity to connect.
GDPR & Data Privacy: In compliance with data privacy regulations, users can now find a "Data Export" feature on their profile page, allowing them to download a complete JSON file of their personal data.
Admin Dashboard: A comprehensive new Admin Dashboard has been created, providing a centralized view of key business and operational metrics, including user engagement, revenue analytics, platform safety statistics, and system health.
Anti-Ghosting System: To encourage better communication habits, the app will now gently "nudge" users by highlighting conversations that have been inactive for several days, helping to prevent ghosting.
With these final additions, LoveLink is now a secure, performant, and feature-rich dating application ready for deployment.
